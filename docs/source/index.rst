MEALPY is a Python library for the most of cutting-edge population *meta-heuristic algorithms* - a field which provides an fast
and efficient way to find the global optimal point of mathematical optimization problems.

Population meta-heuristic algorithms (PMA) are the most popular algorithm in the field of optimization. There are several type of PMA such as:

- Evolutionary inspired computing
- Swarm inspired computing
- Physics inspired computing
- Human inspired computing
- Biology inspired computing
- And others such as: Music inspired, Mathematical inspired computing,...

Features
--------

- Our library provides all of the state-of-the-art population meta-heuristic algorithms for optimization problems.
- We implement all algorithms in Numpy to increase speed of algorithms.
- We've also designed the visualization module to help users understand and explore the result that the model discovers after learning
